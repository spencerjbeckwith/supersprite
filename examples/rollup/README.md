# supersprite rollup example

To get this example running locally:

```
cd examples/rollup
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open [index.html](index.html) in your web browser.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` will build the example app.
- `npm run refresh` will rebuild supersprite, reinstall it into this subdirectory, and rebuild the example app. This is very useful if developing supersprite locally and you want to test a live browser example.
